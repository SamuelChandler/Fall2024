- Both PASTA and RAMN have a CAN bus you can connect to with external adapter 
- (RAMN has an internal CAN adapter which we will not use for the CTF)

## Connecting
Connect adapter CAN_L (pin 2) and CAN_H (pin 7) to the target CAN_L and CAN_H
- Connecting GND is not needed because CAN is a differential bus
