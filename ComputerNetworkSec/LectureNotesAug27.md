# Security Overview 2 

## IT Revolution 
Built Upon
- Computing 
- Networking

# Security Areas

- All connected through the field of Information Security
## Computing 
- related to security by Computer Security

## Networking

- related to security by Network Security
## Security

# Types of Threats

## Natural Causes
tornadoes, fire, and other natural disasters

## Human 
either benign or malicious but threat due to human error attack or otherwise

Malicious Attacks fall under this category and are separated by direct and malicious.

# Policy and Control

## Policy:
Used to dictate the actions of the users on the system to protect against threats

States what is, and is not allowed. 

To many policies may contradict and cause more vulnerabilities.

## Control: 
directions that dictate the Policies that are in place, defined by enforcing rules instead of just stating them. 

# Access Control 
The Who, What, and How something is accessed using a certain policy to enforce if it is allowed. 

# Security Controls

Physical, Procedural, and Technical 

## Goal of security Controls
- Prevention 
- Detection
- Recovery


## Security Control Lifecycle
Threats --> Policy --> Specification --> Design --> Implementation --> Operation

- cycle is not static and can go back to a previous step from any other step 


# Assurance

a measure of how well the system meets its requirements, how well the system does what it is supposed to do.

- Specification
- Design 
- Implementation 

# Operational Issues 

Cost-benefit Analysis
- is prevention cheaper than recovery?

Risk Analysis
- should we protect something? 
- How should we protect the thing? 

Laws and customs 
- are desired security measures illegal? 
- Will People do them 

# Human Issues

Organizational 
- Power and Responsibility
- Financial benefits

Social Engineering 

# Fundamental Security Design Principles 

Security design and implementation techniques that systematically exclude vulnerabilities

13 core design Principles

- Economy of mechanism
- fail safe defaults
- complete mediation
- Open Design 
- Separation of Privilege
- Least Common mechanism
- psychological acceptability
- Isolation
- Encapsulation
- Modularity
- Layering (Defense in Depth)
- Least astonishment


# Security by Obscurity? 
Assumption that security is effective if teh environment  and protection mechanisms are confusing and not generally known (kept secret)

less and less applicable to modern sysems and networks 

# Why is Security Challenging?

Constantly changing landscape 

Economics and difficulty to properly invest 

Lack of Policies

Maintaining attack surface 

growing amounts of complexity 

It systems are usually always open 

Difficult to keep up security with business growth

Network and Computer standards do not consider security standards
