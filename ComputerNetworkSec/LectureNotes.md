# Security Overview 

## Definitions

 ### System Engineering: 
 A job were you solve complex problems involving various hardware and software components working together. Usually involving design, deployment, management, and evolution/termination.

### Security Engineering:
 Branch of systems engineering related to security of real systems, particularly computer systems.

### Computer Security:
 A subset of security engineering referring to security of computer systems.

### Information Security:
 Deals in the trustworthiness of data and Protection of stored or transmitted information/ data from attacks

### Network Security:
 Refers to the protection of transmitted information and network infrastructure.


## What is Security?

Security is used in the sense of minimizing the vulnerabilities of assets and resources

an Asset or resource is anything of value, hardware, software, etc 

A vulnerability is any weakness that could be exploited to violate a system's assets of resources.

A threat is a potential violation of Security.

### Attributes of Security Assets – CIA

Confidentiality
- privacy, secrecy

Integrity
- the ability for the asset to be changed
- also the integrity of the source of the asset

Availability
- how accessible is the asset


## OSI Security Architecture

Defined in ITU-T’s Recommendation, X.800

defines concepts and requirements for securing data networks

also defines security concepts 

defines 3 aspects of information and network security

### Security Attack
Any action that violates the security of information or the network. 

Types: 
- Eavesdropping
- Masquerading
- spoofing
- Man in middle
- DoS
- etc

### Security Mechanism
- Feature designed to detect, prevent, or recover trom a security attack.
- No single mechanism that will support all services required.
- however one particular element underlies many of the security mechanisms in us
- cryptography

Specific Security Mechanisms 
Pervasive Security Mechanisms 

### Security Service

5 types of services that should exist in the system:
- Data Confidentiality: Protect Data form unauthorized disclosure
- Data Integrity: assurance that data received are as sent by an authorized entity
- Authentication
- Access Control
- Non-Repudiation: protection against denial by one of the parties in a communication

## Dos (Denial of Service Attack)

One source of Attack to one desitination 

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)

Multiple Zombies Attacking a single target
